            <p><br>In 2018, I traveled to Tokyo for a research conference representing my school. The first few days in Tokyo did not 
                involve any work but rather exploring the city and its culture. Below are photos of a residential neighborhood in Tokyo 
                along with some restaurant food and a commercial street at night. Compared to the US, homes in Japan are compact 
                and have a much smaller area.

            <p><br>The actual topic of the conference was water quality. Coming from Michigan, two other students and I presented 
                on the Great Lakes of Michigan and our associated research. Below is a photo of me with another student from Spain. 
                The day after, the conference's award cerenomy was cut short due to an imminent typhoon. The way back to my host's
                house involved a lot of water. On my final day, my host family provided me with a sushi breakfast, which ultimately
                got me hooked on sushi when I was stateside.
